# Che-JavaPlugins


## Work Summary 

* During GSoC I have been working on Eclipse CHE, more precisely in Java plugins for code assist / checkers 
(add code recommender, SonarLint and Jacoco).

## Description

* [Eclipse CHE](https://www.eclipse.org/che/) is a developer workspace server and cloud IDE. I have been working on developing the language server for java and the code recommender plugin because the current version version of CHE does not yet have that tool. For this I have been using a Java binding for the Language Server Protocol from [Eclipse LSP4J](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j) and the tool [Eclipse JDT](https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/index.php). That way I have implemented a class named ImplLanguageServer that is a implementation of LanguageServer where it will initialize a TextDocumentService and WorkspaceService, for TextDocumentService I have created ImplTextDocumentService that inherits from it, it will contain a class named TextdocumentModel. 

* The ImplTextDocumentService is responsible for code completion and the TextdocumentModel class that will help access and extract information from the java files. To test the hover method, which gives information about the code where the cursor is, which is executed in ImplTextDocumentService, I implemented the TestTextDocumentService class.

* To initialize the plugin and in turn the workspace I implemented the class JavaLanguageServerPlugin. I also needed to create the ProjectsManeger class that is responsible for managing the workspace projects. In conclusion, it does not complete the project since I just started implementing the plugin code recommender and in this way I also did not add to CHE the support plugins of [SonarLint](http://www.sonarlint.org/eclipse/) and [Jacoco](http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/).This is because I had a lot of trouble understanding and doing a maven plugin, how to use the eclipse jdt tool and how the unit test works. Also I have a error when I run unit test being this “java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError” from a call at  “JavaCore.setOptions (javaCoreOptions);”, from JavaCore documentation it says: "Like all plug-in runtime classes (subclasses of Plugin), this class is automatically instantiated by the platform when the plug-in gets activated. Clients must not attempt to instantiate plug-in runtime classes directly.”.
